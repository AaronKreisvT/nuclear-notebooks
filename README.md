# From Zero to Particles — Jupyter Notebooks

The materials are organized into **7 series**, each consisting of **5 notebooks**.  
They start with absolute programming basics (Python & Jupyter) and gradually move towards topics from nuclear and particle physics.  
Some notebooks may be work-in-progress while I refine content and examples.

---

## 100 — Python & Jupyter Basics
Absolute beginner’s track: Python syntax, variables, control flow, functions, plotting,  
and working effectively in Jupyter notebooks.

- 101–105: First steps, data types, loops, functions, Matplotlib

---

## 200 — Standard Model Primer
From quarks and leptons to hadrons: isospin, hypercharge, and the Eightfold Way.  
Intuition for particle classification and quantum numbers.

- 201–205: Quarks & leptons, hadron multiplets, isospin & hypercharge, Eightfold Way

---

## 300 — Rutherford Scattering
Numerical methods and data analysis around the classic scattering experiment:  
simulate trajectories, fit parameters, and compare with analytic expectations.

- 301–305: ODE setup, numerical integration, cross sections, fits, uncertainty

---

## 400 — Radioactive Decay
Solve decay differential equations symbolically and numerically; use log-plots;  
apply the ideas to dating methods like *radiocarbon (C-14)*.

- 401–405: Decay law, symbolic ODEs, half-life, activity, C-14 dating

---

## 500 — Decay Chains
Extend to chains and coupled ODE systems; transient and secular equilibrium;  
real-world contexts (e.g. background sources like cigarettes).

- 501–505: Coupled ODEs, Bateman equations, equilibria, applications

---

## 600 — Monte Carlo Methods
Random sampling for physics: estimate π, propagate uncertainties,  
and build simple particle-transport toy models.

- 601–605: RNGs, π via Monte Carlo, error propagation, simple transport

---

## 700 — Detectors
Foundational detector physics and examples: nuclear spin basics, mass spectrometry,  
and introductory signal processing for measurements.

- 701–705: Nuclear spin primer, mass spectrometers, signals & spectra

---

**Note:** Each series will get five concise notebooks (≈ 15–30 min each).  
Examples are chosen to be runnable on a standard laptop with common Python libraries.
